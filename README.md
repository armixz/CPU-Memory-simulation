# Computer System Simulation
Multiple Processes and IPC; The project will simulate a simple computer system consisting of a CPU and Memory. The CPU and Memory will be simulated by separate processes that communicate. Memory will contain one program that the CPU will execute and then the simulation will end.

### Project Purpose
This project aims to build a simple computer system with a CPU and memory. In this system, a program is available in memory, and the CPU executes the program line by line and ends the program at the end. 

### Implementation
The program is written in C language, which includes several functions as described below:
